# 2D-Forest-Game
A 2D Game using C# on VS Code and the Unity game engine where the player can explore a forest and collect coins, but enemies will be patrolling and chase the player if they get too close.

Similar to my previous 2D pirate game, this is an adventure maze game where the user must collect items to get score and avoid or eliminate enemies. The enemies will patrol between sets of coordinates until the player is close to them, once the player is close enough they will stop patrolling and begin chasing the player, if the player escapes the enemy will go back to patrolling between the same coordinates. The player has melee attacks they can use to kill enemies if they get close and enemies will die in one hit. Below is a list of settings for different sprites and objects:
Player has 100 health.
Enemies deal 10 damage.
Hearts heal the player for 30 health.
Coins will give 10 gold to the player.
