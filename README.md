# 2D-Forest-Game
A 2D Game using C# on VS Code and the Unity game engine where the player can explore a forest and collect coins, but enemies will be patrolling and chase the player if they get too close.

Similar to my previous 2D pirate game, this is an adventure maze game where the user can collect items to get score and avoid or eliminate enemies. The player has ranged attacks with a bow that they can use to kill enemies and enemies will die in one hit. The Player has animations for running in all four directions and animations for when they attack. Background music plays during game time and chase music plays when the enemy is chasing the player, sound effects play when coins, hearts and gems are picked up. Enemies drop coins on death and rarely drop hearts.

Below is a list of the current modes available

## Adventure Mode
